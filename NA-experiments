These are my numerical analysis class's experiments.
It contains 5 experiments as below.
1.The Gaussian principal element elimination method solves a system of linear equations
2.Spline interpolation
3.Romberg algorithm
4.4th order of Longekatu method
5.Newton's iterative method solves the root of a system of equations
